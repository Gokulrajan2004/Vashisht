Introduction
Aquaculture's success critically depends on maintaining optimal water quality. Our project addresses challenges such as stress, disease, and economic losses due to subpar water conditions by delivering an automated, real-time water quality monitoring and adjustment system. This system, enhanced with Firebase for data access and control, sets new standards in aquaculture water quality management.

Features
Real-time Water Quality Monitoring: Measures ORP, pH, temperature, and TDS continuously.
Remote Access and Control: Leverages Firebase for easy monitoring and adjustments via mobile devices.
Automated Water Adjustment: Uses solenoid valves and motors for immediate water quality corrections.
Fish Feeding Automation: Incorporates a servo motor-based system for optimized feeding schedules.
User-friendly Interface: Features intuitive LCD and mobile interfaces for easy control and monitoring.
Technology Stack
ESP8266 Board: Facilitates WiFi connectivity and system control.
Sensors: For ORP, pH, temperature, and TDS monitoring.
Actuators: Solenoid valves and motors for adjusting water parameters.
Fish Feeding Mechanism: Servo motor-driven for automated feeding.
Data Backend: Firebase for real-time data management and remote operation.
Development Environment: Arduino IDE for programming the ESP8266.
Installation
Hardware Setup
Assemble sensors, ESP8266 board, solenoid valves, motors, and servo motor as detailed in Hardware_Setup.pdf in the docs folder.
Software Configuration
Open Arduino IDE and set it up for the ESP8266 board.
